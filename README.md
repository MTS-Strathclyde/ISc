Usage examples
--------------

As an input script takes a pdb file with single solute. For example (methane.pdb):
```text
ATOM      1  C1  MOL     1       3.537   1.423   0.000  1.00  0.00
ATOM      2  H1  MOL     1       4.089   2.224   0.496  1.00  0.00
ATOM      3  H2  MOL     1       4.222   0.611  -0.254  1.00  0.00
ATOM      4  H3  MOL     1       2.759   1.049   0.669  1.00  0.00
ATOM      5  H4  MOL     1       3.077   1.810  -0.912  1.00  0.00
TER
END
```

                            submited along the xvv file. Solvent density will be
                            taken from it. Otherwise, water solvent density will
                            be used for Isc calculation.

                            your own prmtop file through --prmtop. [1.0]
                        

Notes
-----
The script has been tested only on Ubuntu, but it should work on most Linux distributions and on Mac OS X. To make it Windows-friendly one would probably need to change the names of executable programs and add them to PATH.
